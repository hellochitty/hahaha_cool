Creating this necklace, while technically not difficult, took SO MUCH TIME. Threading wire through tiny beads with tiny holes takes more time than you can imagine.

I LOVE the colors in this piece. The off-white and pink hues, along with the combination of textures of the beads, makes this one of my FAVOURITE pieces. I love it so much that I hesitate to wear it.
