When my childhood friend Arathi told me that she was getting married, I was nothing short of elated. Truth is, it was no surprise that she would marry Nik. The two of them make an electric couple. You can see their colgate smiles from a mile away.

With a close friend's wedding comes a bachelorette party, and friends don't let friends have lame bachelorette party t-shirts! After completing my 100 day project in lettering in late 2015, I was itching to use the lettering for something more than wall art. The bachelorette party shirts were the perfect first project in digitizing lettering. Knowing that this is SUCH an important event meant that I would have to go through with this and make sure that it was AMAZING. 
<br><br>
The first step to creating the shirt was to create sketches. I went through a book of 100 pages practicing my lettering with tombow pens, making sure I had a handle on creating all of the words that I'd use on the shirt. My final sketch was created at a coffee shop, using a coffee cup as a template. It says "Arathi's last fling until the ring"

I then used a brush pen to go over the pencil sketch and create the full hand lettered effect.

Afterwards, I went through with micron pens to smooth edges and even out some letters to prep them for digitization

Next step was to take a picture of the design, up the contrast, and use illustrator to digitize. I used the digitization process to add some extra flourishes.

I sent the final design off to customink who delivered the shirt a WEEK ahead of schedule. All of the shirts were beyond perfect.

Finally, it was time for Arathi's amazing Miami bachelorette party, and we finally got to wear the shirts!

The whole t-shirt creating process was SO FUN. If you're learning a new skill and want to challenge yourself, definitely take on a project you REALLY care about. A motivating cause makes you think outside the box, draft and re-draft, and really go the extra mile to make sure that everything is perfect.
