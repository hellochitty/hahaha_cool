Handmade presents are the best.

Using [this pattern from the purl bee][purlbee-pattern], I knitted a hat in a really beautiful, dark green color. Unfortunately I’ve been out of practice with knitting with all my wrist problems, so this took a little bit longer than expected. The plus side is that I learned some new decrease techniques that I’ll surely employ on other projects.

The hat folds to compact itself. Perfect for a winter coat pocket.

The lighting is a bit different in both the photos, but the true yarn color is most similar to the deep foresty green in the first picture.

I highly recommend this pattern for beginners who can maintain tension and make even stitches. The simplicitiy and uniformity of the stitches is what makes this hat a hit!
