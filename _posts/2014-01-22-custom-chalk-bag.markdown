I've got sweaty hands, which makes rock climbing somewhat of a disaster. Chalk doesn't always help, as it usually combines with the sweat to form mush. Yuck. 
<br><br>
After climbing for a bit, I started using more and more chalk, and needed a chalk bag pronto. Although they aren't too expensive, I thought it would be a fun and easy thing to make and customize.
<br><br>
I ended up making his and hers matching chalk bags that read "don't SWEAT the PETTY" and "PET the SWEATY"

To make the bags, I took a look at bags in stores to reverse engineer them. The supplies are actually quite simple: a microfiber lining for the insite to hold the chalk, a durable outer, elastic cable for pulling the internal fabric tight to prevent chalk escapage, rivets to pull the elastic through, a clampy end piece, and a d-ring for attaching the carabiner.
<br><br> 
I free handed the pattern on some recycled paper, and estimated the dimensions.

Doing the embroidery was probably the most time consuming task,

Sewing the bag together took no time at all, even when adding in the piping around the top of the bag and attaching the D ring.

Most of the details were attached before/during the sewing.

In all it was a super fun and useful project. I highly recommend making your own chalk bag! It's fun, easy, and best of all you have a bag that no one can steal!
