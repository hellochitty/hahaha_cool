Living in a city as CROWDED as New York City, it's hard to believe that sometimes it just feels downright LONELY. There's people all around buzzing about, reading, listening to music, yelling, sleeping, jogging, shopping, eating and just living their lives, but sometimes I can't help but feel isolated. I guess I would liken it to the phrase "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."
<br><br>
This is a subject I really want to delve into more. How can we create genuine interactions between strangers in populous cities? How can we introduce people who would have never met otherwise? Can we make something as hectic and stressful as a rush hour morning subway commute something pleasant that you look forward to?
<br><br>
As a first attempt at solving this problem, I created a hat using the [monogrammed hat pattern from purl soho][monogrammed-hat]. 
<br><br>
Instead of adding just a monogram, I embroidered the word, HI. This is my way of inviting strangers to have conversation with me when I'm wearing the hat.

This hat is a tiniest step of a solution that would need a lot more testing to see if it would be successful. But...wouldn't it be great if on your morning commute, you were wearing a 'Hi!' shirt, and then struck up a conversation with someone wearing a 'Hello!' hat?
