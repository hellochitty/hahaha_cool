The concept for this necklace was simple enough. To make a multi-stranded necklace with two different green beads.

The difficult in this piece lies in the finishing, which was difficult as there were SO many strands, and each of the strands weighed SO MUCH.

Not knowing how the pros do it, I went to Michael's, found a part that looked like I could re-purpose it, and I did!
