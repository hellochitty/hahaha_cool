I fell in love with jewelry making many, many years ago.
Since it was before google was the go-to for learning things, I figured out how to create jewelry by simply reverse engineering pieces that I already had. My first pieces were created using my dad's wire cutter collection, however I soon realised that with the addition of round nose pliers, these tools would actually be more than sufficient. Upon visiting jewelry stores, I soon began to learn about the other jewelry findings and finally put together jewelry that actually looked polished.

This braided pearl necklace was one of those finished products that I still wear.

It was actually quite difficult to make. As you add beads to each of the three wires, you must keep tension on the beads, which becomes increasingly difficult.
